# [CS304] Requirement Analysis Report

## 1. Overview 

### 1.1 Motivation and Background 

This fund management system is mainly to achieve a user information processing and management system. In teachers' daily work and scientific research, they need to constantly apply for and manage funds. So our task is to design a fund application and management system to help teachers deal with related tasks efficiently and conveniently.

### 1.2 Target User or Clients Characteristics 

The users of our system are mainly university teachers and fund approvers. These users have the following characteristics: 1. Representativeness. Teachers usually have their own research groups, which need to apply for funding on behalf of the whole research group. 2. Timeliness. Teachers want grant applications reviewed as soon as possible.

### 1.3 Project Scope 

This system mainly takes the teacher who applies for the management fund as the user, and the auditor who reviews the fund as the manager, which is temporarily applied in Southern University of Science and Technology.

### 1.4 Overall Goal 

To register the teacher as a user, the user has the attributes of the research group to which he belongs. If the user runs multiple research groups, he can view the information/forms of these research groups, and then maintain his fund balance, fund application, etc. At the same time, record the fund utilization rate and other information of the project he applied for. The approver, as the administrator, should be able to decide whether the application form is approved or not, if it is not approved, go back to the application to modify it, and if it is approved, check whether the application is complete.
